# MachineKnight ðŸ¤–

All the Data analysis and model training are in ML folder. <br>
All the Frontend and Flask application are in WebApp folder.<br>
**As the size of model are more than 20 MB the Model Weights are in drive. Download the model from GDRIVE the link is in WebApp/models/ .txt file and place them in same WebApp/models/ directory** <Br>

``` diff
- The **prediction** for the **test data** are in the **/ML/submission.csv**. 
```

The Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Prepration are done in **EDA_DataPrep.ipynb** file.<br>

The model architecture and training are in **train.ipynb** file.


# MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH
It is a **regression** task. The features are in countinous and categorial.

## Pipeline for data prepration.
1. Converting a categorical to numerical data.
2. Removing the outliers.
3. The new features are added.
    i) No. of bathroom, balconies, cup_board per floor
    ii) Ratio of bathroom, balconies, cup_board with respect to property size
4. Then the data is normalized to certain range using RobustScaling methods.

## Model Training
1. The **deep neural network** model is trained using **K-Fold**.<br>
    i)  The **"Mean Absolute Error"** is used as loss function.<br>
    ii) The training **MAE loss** for the model is about **2700** and **RMSE** is about **3764**<br>
    iii) In each fold the model is trained for **100 epochs** with the **learning rate** of **1e-3**.<br>
2. The same data is used to train other 4 models BaggingRegressor, ExtraTreesRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor at the end they are with the training RMSE loss of 3770, 3923, 3773, 3731.
3. All these models are ensembled for prediction.

The API was developed in python FLASK.<br>

```diff
>> pip install -r requirements.py <br>
>> cd WebApp <br>
>> python main.py<br>
```
